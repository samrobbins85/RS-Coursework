\subsection{Data description}

The data is from the Yelp dataset \cite{b1}, this contains a list of the businesses on Yelp, detailing which categories they fall under. It also contains all the reviews, including a written review along with a range of scores. This also now contains a COVID-19 dataset, which lists the changes businesses are making due to COVID-19. There are around 8 million reviews in the review dataset.

\subsection{Data preparation and feature selection}

In order to make the data easier to process, along with increasing the accuracy of predictions, it is needed to reduce the number of reviews. First I selected just restaurants, but as this is a large part of Yelp, it only reduced the dataset to 5 million reviews. So I have reduced it to just Italian restaurants, shrinking the dataset to around 470k reviews. In addition, limiting the timescale reduces the impact of tastes changing over time, so I have only included reviews after 2016. This reduced the number of reviews to around 270k, which is enough to give a good sample, but small enough to be practical to process.
