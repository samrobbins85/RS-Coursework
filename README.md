Coursework from the Recommender Systems Module

`output.json` is all the reviews, but with the text taken out to make it faster to read

`output_business` is all the business IDs of whatever filter I choose

`output_final` is all the reviews of businesses in `output_business`

- About 5 million reviews of restaurants
- About 470k reviews of italian restaurants

`covid_usable` is the covid dataset rewritten as a JSON list so it can be processed easier

`output_covid` is the covid dataset filtered by the businesses, and with "TRUE" replaced with `true` for ease of use
